# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Description
My motivation was to test and utalize the skills covered in this module such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Why I built this project is because I wanted to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. The problems I solved were how to create a timed quiz and set up a responsive interface. What I learned was how to write and create a timed coding quiz with multiple choice questions and a score calculator.
